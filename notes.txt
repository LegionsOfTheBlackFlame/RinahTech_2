18/4 notes
I think I won't have to do any back-end work at all for this project, which is a blessing. 
Video hosting can be done on youtube. For booking they want to use Whatsapp, which I will implement via a widget.
Google reviews also seem to be pretty straight forward to implement. 

20/4 notes
Home page needs to display google reviews
the website will need a gallery page to display photos and videos.
videos will be hosted on Youtube. 
the website's contact page will include links to the socials, address of the club, email address and phone number
the About page needs to list certificates and work history
Fotter needs to include the logo, PADI seal

Gallery process:
Images and videos must be displayed together at first. Gallery control buttons both checked initially, hide
the corresponding file types when unchecked. All images and videos are sorted by data from newest to oldest
