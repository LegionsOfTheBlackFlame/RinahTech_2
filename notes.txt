18/4 notes
I think I won't have to do any back-end work at all for this project, which is a blessing. 
Video hosting can be done on youtube. For booking they want to use Whatsapp, which I will implement via a widget.
Google reviews also seem to be pretty straight forward to implement. 

20/4 notes
Home page needs to display google reviews
the website will need a gallery page to display photos and videos.
videos will be hosted on Youtube. 
the website's contact page will include links to the socials, address of the club, email address and phone number
the About page needs to list certificates and work history
Fotter needs to include the logo, PADI seal

Gallery process:
>> pass a youtube playlist to "list videos"
>> for each video on the playlist extract the url/ description and title
>> for each video item create item card and pass the extracted info
